# aws-devops-open-scripts

This is a set of small scripts that interact with AWS, Jira, and Bitbucket. Most of them are simple boto3 asynchronous scripts with Jira and Bitbucket integrations. They help automate tasks and improve workflows compared to clicking through the slow front ends of those services.
These scripts can help track issues and ensure they are resolved and merged in a timely manner. Others help automate the closing of environments on AWS ElasticBeanstalk or reopening them a few days later for more testing.
Overall, these scripts help improve efficiency and make work more enjoyable.
